# apos-twitter

apostrophe-twitter is a widget for the [Apostrophe](http://github.com/punkave/apostrophe) content management system. apostrophe-twitter lets you add a Twitter feed to any content area created with Apostrophe. apostrophe-twitter is also intended as a demonstration of how to add custom widgets to Apostrophe and enable their use in your project. See [apostrophe-sandbox](http://github.com/punkave/apostrophe-sandbox) for a project that demonstrates how to use apostrophe-twitter.

Due to Twitter's API access policies, you must [register a Twitter "app"](https://dev.twitter.com/) to use this module. The `consumerKey` and `consumerSecret`, `accessToken` and `accessTokenSecret` options must be set when initializing the module. After registering your app on dev.twitter.com, click "create my access token." Then refresh the page as Twitter usually fails to display the token on the first try.
